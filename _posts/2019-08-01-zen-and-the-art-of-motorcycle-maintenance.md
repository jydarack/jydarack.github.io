After reading a lot about this book for... pretty much forever, I finally decided to buy it as a *light* read. to balance the current technical books I'm into.

Well, not as light as I expected...

## Part 1

### Chapter 1 to 6

will be completed later, need to reread and take notes on these parts

### Chapter 7

And then, suddenly, the Buddha enters the discussion. I get it's part of the zen thing but so far, the book read more like european philosophy.

### Chapter 8

OK, background story, with a nice dose of ye olde electroshock therapy.

### Chapter 9

Aka, what is the scientific method and problem solving approach.

Interesting how this books mixes concepts I know with a US-in-the-60s ambiance I don't.

### Chapter 10
