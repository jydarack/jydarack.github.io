One of the too many books on propaganda I took.

Compared with the others I read in parallel, this one is less research based and more experienced base. The author being an US analyst, the book is more hawkish and US-focused than other books and articles on the topic.

The main message of the book would be : social engineering exists, here are some concepts from the Cold War (both offense and defense) which are useful to understand and use it. But it stays at quite a high level and I would have prefered (but will research on my own) more details on these techniques.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. This is clearly not a book for me. It fell so many times from my hand I had to push through and commit finishing it. I don't revel in war stories.
