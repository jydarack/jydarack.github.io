I am currently re-reading the Foundation series. The notes on the other books are found below, the links will be updated as I go through the books:

- [Foundation's edge]({% post_url 2021-09-13-foundation-edge %})
- [Foundation and Earth]({% post_url 2021-09-28-foundation-earth %})


This is clearly the book I remember the most. The Mule (and the plot twist in Second Foundation) is clearly the event I remember the most vividly when thinking about the whole series.

That said, what I had forgotten was that there was a first part to this book. The General is well... I do understand that this story cements the whole "The Foundation can not fail" mentality in the book but, I just finished the book and I had to check who were the main characters. This story is a memory black hole to me. Nothing sticks.

The Mule on the other hand... Well, knowing the story / final twist from the get go did spoil reading a bit. But it still made following the four protagonists enjoyable. The final chapter reminded me of the end of Kill Bill Volume 2 (though it should be the other way round). Not big fight in the end, just a long dialogue and exposition. Which, at least for me, works fine.

I am also starting to see some limitations on these short fictions. The characters tend to be paper thin. I know it does change in his later books when he has more time to develop them (and that's why I love Demerzel). But still. I have a hard time remembering the names of the main characters, always wondering if they are just throw-aways. Having started the next book in the series (Second Foundation), I am happy to welcome back Han Pritcher, which at least offers some continuity and opportunity for character development.

## Final word

Still a big yes for me. Not as insightful as the first volume though.
