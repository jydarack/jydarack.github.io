This one was a complete impulse buy to fill a package from France. But I don't regret it.

If in term of content, I did not learn much from this book, I really appreciated how David Spiegelhalter wrote it and articulated around key concepts and built on them chapters after chapters. Though statistics and probability can be extremely maths-heavy, the book is not. Concepts are clearly explained and maths is relegated to the appendix.

Another thing I did appreciate is that the author builds from his own experiences in the UK and as such, it's really enjoyable to see examples beyond the usual datasets. Still, the Titanic dataset makes a regular appearance.

## Final word

If you are looking for an introduction to stats as used in the wild, this is a great, well-written book.
