It's that time of the year when I pick a few books which received an award in the previous months.

Storywise, not much to say beyond the pitch: one day, women all around the world wake up with a super power: the ability to generate and control electricity.

And the whole book is how this *super* power leads to *social* power.

It is extremely well-written and there are some chapters which were extremely painful to read.

Overall, I loved this book, partially for the overall malaise that pretty much all characters made me feel.
