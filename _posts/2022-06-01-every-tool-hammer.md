Why did I pick this book? I don't even know how I came to know of its existence. I mean, I am not a fan of Adam Savage. I have not seen more than 5 episodes of Mythbusters and I am not even sure I want to see more.

Sure, I never missed any documentary on special effects when I was a kid. I from time to time, I watch Adam Savage's One Day Build and really enjoy them. And that might be the main reason as to why I bought the book. His passion transpires in each of these videos and it is highly contagious.

So I had no real expectations for the book. And having finally read it, I still don't know where I stand.

It is not an autobiography. Even an unconventional one.

It is not really a maker's how-to book. Not really.

It is both. It is neither.

There are autobiographical elements. There are examples of his built and his processes. There are sections where he geeks about random tools (glue...).

So once again, his passion transpires in the book. There are some really good things in it. But would I recommend it ? A solid meh
