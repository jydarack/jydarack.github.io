Two weeks after having actually finished reading the book, I have still not made up my mind.

The book gets into details about the different way the Silicon Valley thinks about itself. Or rather, affects to be thinking about itself as, asI understand it, the author's main point is that SV thinking or philosophy, no matter how many "thinkers" they might invoke, is as best surface level.

I did enjoy the book but, like other books I have reviewed here, I feel like its content has already been digested in the podcasts and other tech-critical content I have reading / listening to elsewhere. It lacks the wow effect so many of its readers semms to be having. Which is weird as the book has only been published in 2020. Let's put that on its success.

## Final word

As I said, I still have not made up my mind about it. If you are already deep into tech-critical discourse, you might already be aware of it's content. Otherwise, if you have an interest in the topic, go for it, it is still a reference book for the field.
