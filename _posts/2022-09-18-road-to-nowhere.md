This one was a book I had been waiting for to read for a long time. I started listening to the Tech Won't Save Us at the beginning of the pandemic AND swtiched to a car-related job this year so *of course* I was interested in what TWSU's host, Paris Marx had to say. It just took me forever to start reading the book (eventhough I pre-ordered it) and even more time to write this review (fighting epic sized brain melt right now).

Paris Marx goes into great details into the history of our relationship with cars how human behaviour has been molded and adjusted around it and how tech solutionism now tries to sell more car-solutions to everyone car-problems. In a nice "just add another lane" kind of way. Beyond just the business or economical aspects of the issues, they also present how power dynamic work in the area, either in a systemic way or in more individualistc ways, such as with Musk trying to sell his tunnels to derail high-speed trains projects (which he despises) but mostly because he didn't want to deal with other people on the road during his commute.

Finally, Marx doesn't stop at just giving a depressing view of the current Silicon Valley mentality, but also provide elements and possible actions for everyone to retake the issue in our hand and not just let a handful of disconnect millionaires (and up) decide for us how we want to move around.

## Final word

An essential addition to anyone interested in car culture and car innovation in general or to anyone interested in tech criticism.
