One of the books that I saw being recommended time and time again. And since I was making an order at Verso books and wanted some ecology-related books, that was an evident choice.

I also finished reading it a few days before the explosion of the Nordstream pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Which, well, made for interesting thoughts.

The main point of the book is "given how bad the oil and car industry is, how come there has not been more destructive actions against it and its symbols". 

Andreas Malm seems to have (had?) ties with extinction rebellion and was part of a few actions as part of the group and he also aknowledges some of the issues around the group structure and actions.

## Final word

Strangely, I can't say much more about this book. It was a pleasant read. Beyond that, I guess its main themes have already filtered in other books and have been reprocessed since its publication.

It is still relevant and the recent actions on artworks linked to oil money prove it.
