A book I saw being recommended in my now defunct Twitter feed.

All in one, it's more journalistic than analytic, mostly staying at the description level of things. The authors do a good job introducing the work of researchers or other authors but that mostly lead me to want to drop the book and see what they had to say.

Some of the sources they quote seem to also have a pretty dubious reputation of being antivaxx, homo- and transphobic etc. Hard hitting on the left but forgetting to mention affiliation or recuperation of the movements they mention with/by the far right.

All this might be due to the book supporter/sponsor (Reporterre), a French ecology website/blog/magazine which orients which topics are discussed and as such reflects a certain ecological *mouvance*. Not for me. And after a few comments in the first chapters which made me raise eyebrows one time too many, I ended up checking the background of each and every person and organisation they mention or quote. Not as far-right and conspiracy leaning the first chapters seem to indicate but very right leaning overall.

## Final word

Not for me. Not a deal breaker as I managed to finish reading it. There are a few of the authors and researchers quoted in the book whose work I'll try to read later but I would not recommand this book.
