A book in the same vein as [Robo Sapiens Japanicus]({% post_url 2022-03-17-robo-sapiens-japanicus %}), this time on VR, of course I had to read it. Especially after spending some time writing a [long blog post](https://achikochi.tokyo/fr/blog/les-guides-du-pif/metavers-au-japon/) on the topic some time ago.

And this book is damn good.

It's a deep dive into the history of VR in Japan since the 1950s. Into the manga/anime/books on the topic. But the main things the author dives into are the social impact the promoteurs of VR see for its application. And damn, this is bad. Very bad.

This is clearly a book I will come back to very often, same as Robo Sapiens Japanicus.

It also mentioned a few books I already ordered/started reading..

## Final word

Buy it, read it !
