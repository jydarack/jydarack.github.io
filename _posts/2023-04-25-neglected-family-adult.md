I was recently diagnosticated with ADHD and, while I was also recommended [a book on the subject]({% post_url 2023-04-27-adult-adhd-control-guide %}) by the doctor, this was popped up in my feed and seems more attuned to what I was looking for.

So this books/manga follows Nekoze, a yound woman very recently diagnosed with ADHD avec having lived for years with OCD after suffering neglect from her family.

It is deeply personal, touching on the different issues she encountered growing up and how her symptoms evolved with her environment as well as her reaction to her diagnostic that she first considers critically.

From a family with two brothers with different levels of ASD, she was supposed to be the *normal child* and lacked support from her parent. The whole *normal child* thing hit me hard given the expectations described in the book.

One thing I started noticing is how much Japanese books/sites on ADHD tend to relate it to ゴミ屋敷 or Diogene syndrom. ADHD is related to messiness in what I have read elsewhere but never to this point. Is this only a Japan thing ? Or an additional stigma on this particular issue ?

## Final word

Hard to recommend. It is good. If you are not afraid of reading about some heavy topics, you might be interesting but this is quite a niche book.
