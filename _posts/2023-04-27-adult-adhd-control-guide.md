An additional book on ADHD from the Japanese perspective, this one recommended by the doctor who made my diagnostic. Not much to say. Kinda generic content though there are some actionnable things in the second part of the book.

For French-speaking audience (though I do remember an english version is also available), [Mon cerveau a **encore** besoin de lunettes]({% post_url 2022-08-04-cerveau-encore-besoin-lunettes %}) is far better.
