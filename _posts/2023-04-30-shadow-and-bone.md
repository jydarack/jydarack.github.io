I liked the adaptation on Netflix a few years ago and after seeing recommandation for Young Adults books on Instagram or TikTok and with me visiting, by pure chance, a bookshop, I decided to buy the whole set.

I devoured the first book in basically one seating. I was not expecting much but the book hit just the right level of adventure, magic and character development.

Don't know if that's because I hadn't read YA books in years but I was kinda positively surprised.

The only comment I would have is that the book feels like it is standalone. So I ended wondering if the second *and third* books were just diluted content to respond to the hype or if there was a real good story in them.
