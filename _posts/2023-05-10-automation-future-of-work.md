Picked this book while trying to improve my knowledge on tech criticism.

The book is extremely interesting but I still feel like I only understood 30% of it.

It is extremely well documented, drawing analysis on history, macro-economics, previous dissertations and so on. As such I feel like I don't have the necessary bagage to make the most of it.

I thought the whole discussion on what was automation and why it led to lower GDP growth despite its advertised goals and the whole discussion that ensues. The comparison of the different approach regarding universal basic income is also extremely thorough and welcome as, even though i know the subject on a very basic level, the details were brand new to me.

## Final word

I'll have to read it again, later in my life. Not beginner friendly. Or for beginner with a better head than mine.
