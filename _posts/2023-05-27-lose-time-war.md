This is one of those books which suddenly seemed to be everywhere on the internet. I had it on my Want-to-read list for some time but it's listening to one of the recent [Cory Doctorow's interviews]({% post_url 2023-05-24-red-team-blues %}) where he recommended the book finally decided me to buy it (as well as the other books he recommended).

And I am extremly happy to have finally read it.

Think a mix between Romeo and Juliet and replacing the two families by two different possible futures (one Avatar-blue *viney-hivey elfworld*, the other Terminator-eye-red *techy-mechy dystopia*), each discovering the other through letters to each others. A ennemy to lover story.

The book structure can be a bit repetitive, one chapter with context and letter discovery, the letter in the following chapter, then switching point-of-view and again. But it flows extremely well and it makes discovery the whole world(s?) a pleasure.

And it's very well written. More like poesy than prose. Kinda reminds me of *Be there tio love me at the end of the world* (which I should finish reading someday).

## Final word

Read it.
