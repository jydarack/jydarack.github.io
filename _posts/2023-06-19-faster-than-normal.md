Why the fuck did I buy this book??? It was recommended by one of the few ADHD content creators I tolerate.

This book is supposed to focus on the good aspects of ADHD and how to capitalise on them.

But, damn, how american this book is.

It basically a summary of many self-help books on task management from the past 10 years. Having gone through a lot of them when I was trying to understand why the fuck I couldn't do stuff. Which both should have been early warning signs for ADHD.

So put all the positive vibes. Write as if you were doing a presentation. Speak as if the reader were your best friend. Take every opportunity to advertise you businesses or how successfull you are.

Nope nope nope. Big goop energy there.

It might work for the US audience but that's a list of red flags for me.

But that were just vibe red flags for me. I mean, I have read, and in the end enjoyed, books for which I first hated the style. But as I was reading the first chapters, I was feeling less and less welcomed.

The list of *famous people who also happened to have ADHD* which I kinda understand is a stapple of this kind of books managed to list only men. Including Wernher von Braun. Who gets his own blurb. Which *forgets* to mention who this asshole was and his actions before operation paperclip.

## Final word

Nope. Never.
