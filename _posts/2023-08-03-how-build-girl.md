This is a book that had been waiting on my want-to-read list for quite some time so I forgot why I put it there in the first place.

I started reading not expecting much. The book was on my TBR pile. I try to reduce the size of my pile which is getting higher and higher, never a good thing in an earthquake-prone country. It was high enough when I was loooking for some fiction book. Let's go.

As the title might hint, this is a coming-of-age story. Set in the late- and early-post-Thatcher area in Britain, we follow Johanna aka Dolly Wilde, a 13 to 17-yo working-class girl trying to find her place in the early 1990s Britain. Both a deep dive into the working class of the time as well as the music scene of the time.

It is extremely good. The writing is powerful. The story griping. I can only recommend the book
