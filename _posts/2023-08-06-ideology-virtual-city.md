Part of a group of books on urbanism I am currently hyperfocusing on. Or so I thought.

The book actually focuses more on the urban way of life as set in videogames and how it informs on the hidden capitalism / (neo)liberalism subtext and how, even in games with a cynical message on the system, they are still dominant.

The author goes through 4 games: Saints Row IV, GAT V, No More Heroes and Persona 5, two american and two japanese games. More than the games, it also uses 4 archetypes of characters with regards to neoliberalism (hedonism, cynicism. consumerism/escapism and reformism) and how these archetypes interact with the story, the environment and the gameplay through both psychology and sociology.

## Final word

The book is extremely short (89 pages) so it can be a good short read if you are into the topic
