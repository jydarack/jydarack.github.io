Picked this book after coming across the title quite a few time and not giving it much thoughts because that’s not the kind of books I usually read or look for. And I was wrong. This book was great and one of the most fun read of this year so far.

The concept is simple: what if Kaiju existed, mostly in a parallel dimension but brought in our own by huge release of radioisotopes. And an organisation is making sure they don’t cross over.

That’s the pitch. Very simple presented this way but the book reads as the detailed synopsis for the first season of a decent sci-fi TV show. And I mean that in a good way. The pacing, character presentation and background, correct balance between presentation and action, a good crescendo and payoff in the last part…

And even more bonus points for having made the main antagonist an actual tech bro in all his glorious bullshit.

An interesting element I noticed is that even though kaijus are an important element of the book, even featured in its title, they are just barely described. We know some fly, some are reptile-like and so on but their général shape is unclear. I thought that was an interesting choice.

## Final word

I can only recommend this book. Fun, short and easy-to-read.
I’ll also have a look at the other books by this author.
