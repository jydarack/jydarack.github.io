Having read a few Doctorow books lately (namely [here]({% post_url 2023-06-06-chokepoint-capitalism %}) and [here]({% post_url 2023-05-24-red-team-blues %})), I was curious of his new book.

This time, he focuses on interoperability, right to repair etc. A good part of the book describes how the current environment came into being and how it aggregated into the ball of mess we are in right now.

In a way, a good part of the book is shared with what he wrote in Chokepoint Capitalism, partially because the book deals with some of the same actors. But compared with this previous book, it is much easier to read, much more like his non-fiction books. And, as I had noted in my review of Chokepoint Capitalism, that's a very good thing.

One thing this book made me realise is that I should stop listening to author interviews when I have already pre-ordered the book because most elements have already been discussed over and over by the time I finally receive my book (usually 1 month after the release)

## Final word

Interesting. Not sure if I would recommend the book as Doctorow shares his ideas very freely. That said, these ideas are interesting.
