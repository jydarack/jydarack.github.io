Should I really mention why I bought a book every time. Actually, I forgot why I bought this exact book...

Anyway. I don't regret it.

And if I usually struggle writing about books I like, this one is better kept un-summarised. The book is built around a few plot pivot and explaining any elements would give clues about the overall plot.

The book is extremely good and if I had some difficulties starting reading, I was hooked after the first pivot. There's a lot in common with the serie 1899 in the overall ambiance. Funny also that the main ship is named *Demeter* at the same time *The last Voyage of the Demeter* was released

## Final word

Safe purchase
