Picked up the book while looking for a change in style and content, so why not lovecraft-inspired horror. It doesn't hurt that the book had a lot of good reviews.

First, let's say that I did read some of Lovecraft's books or novels or whatever and... meh, it never really clicked with me.

So, this book. It is... good ? I enjoyed reading it. I liked the stories, characters and overall atmosphere of it. I liked the story being told from the point of view of a black extended family in the 50s. 

It definitely feels like the script of a Netflix serie.

## Final word

But, I don't know. Should I give it a note, things I usually don't do, it would be solid 3 out of 5. It is solid. Just not 100% for me ?

Even with that, I will certainly buy the follow-up book at some point, especially after reading [Cory Doctorow's review this week](https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/21/the-horror-of-white-magic/#anti-lovecraftian)
