What if Dr Seuss explained David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs to kids.

Here, you have the pitch for the first story of the book.

Basically a book built like a children book but with addressing bullshit jobs, depression or ADHD or the quest for meaning as an adult...

And written and illustrated by the duo behind the long running webcomic [War and Peas](https://warandpeas.com).

It's fun, very quick to read

And fun.
