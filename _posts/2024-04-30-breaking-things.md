One of the first books I bought when I started to understand better the current tech environment. And it took me 2 years to finally finishing it.

## What is it about ?

As hinted by the book subtitle, the book starts with the Luddites. But beyond the revolt and the history of actual breaking of things (though there is a fair share of that), the focus of the book is how *technological progress* has been weaponised against the workers, from the early days of the factory system to the current gig economy. More than a linear history lesson on the topic, Gavin Mueller also researched how workers and organisations (from the socialist parties and unions of the early 20th century to members of the civil right movements and the feminists movements).

## Final word

Not the easiest read but I really liked how he covered the whole topic and how institutions and movements dealt with it.
