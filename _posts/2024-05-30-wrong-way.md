A technocritic (science-) fiction book? Count me in!

## What is it about

We follow Teresa who after years jumping from temp position to gig jobs joins the AllOver *driverless* taxis division as... a driver.

From work alienation, bullshit jobs, (litteral) worker invisibilisation, Silicon Valley bullshit marketing speak and "visionary" founder, everything is here.

## Final word

This review extremely short but I read through the book in 2 days because I was taken by the story and characters. I'm sure a lot can be said about the style and everything but my main take away is that Joanne McNeil captured the current tech environment from the worker perspective in a very profound way.
