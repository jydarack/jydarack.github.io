I preordered the book when discussion around recommandation algorithms seemed to dominate the discussions in my circles. It's only a bit later that I made the connection with his previous work around [Airspace](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification) which is a concept I refer very often.

## What is it about ?

The author focuses on how algorithms command more and more how we experience life, both online and offline. And beyond that, how abuse of recommander systems and similar algorithms tend to orient everyone toward content or experiences close to the average, excluding what it considers outliers or anything that is specific to a market or a subculture.

Long live the Long tail, you are now experiencing content which is supposedly highly specific, as long as it fits one of the relatively few categories the platforms has selected.

## Final word

I enjoyed the book but... I found it most relevant on the offline aspects.

This could be because that was what I am most interested in and how I first read Kyle Chayka's writing. Or it could be because I have had more than enough discourse on filter bubbles and recommandation engines online.
