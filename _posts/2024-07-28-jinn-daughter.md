After a month reading mostly non-fiction or academic books, I needed some time off. I had bookmarked The Jinn Daughter following a nice review in the [Literary Liberation podcast](https://podcastaddict.com/literary-liberation/episode/176260084).

## What is it about ?

The book is centred around Nadine, a Hakawati, a jinn whose role is to help souls pass into the afterlife by telling their life story. She lives alone with her daughter, her husband having killed himself to protect them during the purge against jinns instigated by his own father.

And... once again, I don't know how to summarise the book beyond that, even though the above paragraph do not summarise any of the book content.

It's a story about motherly love, in, through, by and beyond death. It's a story about fate, about failures, about accepting your children and the paths they take, about not forcing them on a life they do not want.

I loved it.

## Final word

Once again, I loved it. I was hooked almost as soon as I started reading and almost read it in one setting.

It's Rania Hanna's debut novel and she nailed it. Style, story, mi-eastern folklore, emotions. It was just great.

*Keep her safe.
Keep her happy.
Let her find good love.
Let her know peace.
Let her know her heart and mind.
Let her be*
