I forgot exactly what made me put the book in my wishlist but I realised I listened to [Kelly Link's interview in So Many Damn Books](https://www.somanydamnbooks.com/episodes/episode-200) last year.

## What is it about

Short version: it's a collection of short stories, or more precisely of modern fairy tales.

All stories are subtitled with the traditional fairy tale it matches (*The white cat*, *The musicians of Bremen*...). Most of them didn't ring any bell to me.

## Final words

It's fun, it's queer, it's extremely well written. It was the perfect read for me right now.

I liked every story in the collection. The only one that didn't really click with me was *The Girl Who didn't Know Fear*. I enjoyed the story-telling but I couldn't find or understand the conclusion.
