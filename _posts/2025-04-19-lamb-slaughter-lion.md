Picked up the book after reading a lot about the author on the Our Opinions are Correct discord. And because I listen to her interventions in the numerous [CoolZone Media podcasts](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-cool-people-who-did-cool-96003360/) she cohosts or regularly takes part in.

## What is it about

Danielle Cain just arrived in the anarchist community of Freedom, Iowa, trying to understand what led her best friend and mentor Clay to take his life.

Except, she’s immediately confronted with the resident supernatural being, Uliksi, a demon in deer form eating the heart of anyone seeking power over anyone.

The book is short (~130 pages) and punchy. Much more than a horror story, it’s an essay on anarchist utopias and their limit, on people facing their own demons and conflicts. Easy to relate with L'imaginaire au pouvoir and The Dispossessed which tackle similar topics in different contexts.

## Final word

Loved the book. I didn’t know what to expect and just chose it because I wanted to read one of Margaret Killjoy’s books and just bought her most well-known.

Highly recommended.
