The title itself was intriguing and, as one who always try to look through half-opened doors, it was a good-enough reason to buy it.

## What is it about

Fetter leaves his hometown to the bigger city of Luriat and find himself drawn to the bright doors, a weird phenomena found solely in this city. In the background, religious sects and political factions try to grow their influence while a pandemic is ongoing.
## A bit more

The best comment on the [Goodreads page for the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61884985-the-saint-of-bright-doors) reveals the main twist of the book: the story is a recollection of the rise of the Buddha, as seen from his son whom he threw away. You can read the book without this information but it adds layers to the whole thing.

## Final words

Really enjoyed this book though it took me ages to finish.

## Out of standard English words I enjoyed

The books is sprinkled with English words I had never encountered before, some of them first looking like typos but with interesting nuances. Looking for their definition and etymology added to the fun:

- Megrim
- Alarum
- Bathos and bathetic
- Gramarye
