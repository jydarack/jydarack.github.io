One of my favourite Discworld books. Same as with Monstrous Regiment, I bought the new Death Edition, with it's nice new cover.

## What is it about?
Bring together two orphans, one brought up in the Guild of Thieves then by the History monks, and the other brought up by the Timekeeper's Guild.
Add a dash of Apocalypse, Ronnie the Milkman, Time herself, chocolates and you have a perfect moment.

## A bit more
I love pretty much all the characters in this book. It's both build well-enough as well as absurd enough to keep you on your toes all along.

I remembered a hammer was important at some point in the story so I was psyched reading the complete name of the main protagonist was Lobsang **Ludd**. That's what reading too much about the Luddites do to your brain. But no big Enoch moment here, and Lobsang is not even the one wielding the hammer.

## Final word
Read it.

And remember Rule One.
