Bought after some recommandations in technocritic circles. I wanted to get some up to date reference on cyborg discourse without going all the way to Hathaway’s *Cyborg Manifesto*.

## What is it about

Labour, art, society, self, discourse, the authors go through each of these areas and give a panoramic views of the challenges, impact, and discourses with a feminist cyborg technocritic approach of the topic.

The definition of the cyborg itself is quite wider than expect as it encompass human performing tasks alongside automation or software and not just the sci-fi body-modification-heavy image I had in mind.

## A bit more

The book is thought as an entry point into cyborg discourse and as such covers a lot of ground.

That said, as I was reading I kept thinking that the author were taking some element, some réflexion or some key step of their framework for granted. Like climbing a stair three by three. You can do it but it’s uncomfortable. Even with having finished it, I still feel there are a bunch of key puzzle pieces missing.

## Final word

I really don’t know.
