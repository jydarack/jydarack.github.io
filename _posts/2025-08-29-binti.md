Bought after seing suite à few recommandations and being intrigued of novellas.

## What is it about?

Difficult here to not copy what’s on the back of the book. Binti is Himba, a people bound to and with strong ties to its land. Except her mathematical prowesses just earned her a place in the best university in the galaxy. And she wants to go.

Except her ship is attacked en route by Meduse, and everyone is killed except her. She now has to find a way to survive and find a way out of the situation. For she is a master harmoniser, one who brings peace.

## A bit more

Maths as magic? Count me in!

Overall, the sci-fi elements take a back seat in the story. Acceptation, of oneself, the other and of change is the core of the 4 novellas making up this trilogy (don’t ask).

## Final word

Great feel-good read. Not all novellas are of the same quality or rhythm but as a whole, it’s a very well balanced story, exploring some elements while letting a bunch of others still unexplained.
