Picked-up after listening too many podcasts mentionning it very positively.

## What is it about ?

At the highest level, it’s a feminist comparative politics book. Using the fall of the USSR as a natural experiment and comparing the situation between capitalist countries, state socialist and liberal socialism countries, the author analyses how financial independence freed women in socialist countries and what steps these countries took to achieve such results.

While the key message is quite positive about socialist countries overall, she does not shy pointing out the dark side of the system as well as the policy failures or limitations.

## Final word

I’ll be joining the chorus and say it’s a must-read.
