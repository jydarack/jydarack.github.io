Avid reader of sci-fi and concerned about the trend of technofascists referencing the genre as a model, I wanted to read a deep-dive into the subject.

## What is it about?

AS per the book's subtitle: *Science Fiction and the Alt-Right*. How science fiction includes far-right elements, how and what is adopted by the alt-right and how the alt-right pushes its themes into the sci-fi they publish or recommend.

## A bit more

The main thing I can say is that the author is very thorough in their presentation and the examples they include. A bit too much for my taste because in the end, they include a lot of the far-right talking points.

A good and thorough look into the topic but not that much new information or analysis.

## Final word

If that's one of your topics of interest
