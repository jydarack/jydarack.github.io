Always trying to read at least one of the winner of the big Sci-Fi Awards of the year, I picked The tainted cup.

## What is it about?

A polar in a biohacker fantasy setting with two neurodivergent main characters. With huge creatures threatening to destroy everything.

## A bit more

One of the recent cozy fantasy books of the moment, including the characters regularly sipping tea.

## Final word

Not much to say in this review. I liked the setting, the characters, the story and read through the book in a few days.

Is good, read it.
