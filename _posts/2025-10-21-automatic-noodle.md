Having really like Annalee Newitz' previous books, I pre-ordered their new novel and read it pretty much immediately.

## What is it about?

The year is 2064. A bunch of robots with various past occupations, forms and statuses team up to start a noodle restaurant in a war destroyed San Francisco.

Think cozy cyberpunk post-apo Sci-Fi. Yes, that's a genre. At least, it is now.

## Final word

This review is extremely short as the whole book is too and, as a cozy sci-fi book, it's better experienced than explained.

Overall, I really enjoyed the story, its cast and overall hopeful mood.
