I was reading another book (The red years) on the topic of the 1968-69 student protests but I wanted to further my reading of [Tokyo 68]({% post_url 2025-11-04-tokyo-68 %}) by reading the other book on the topic by one of the co-author.

## What is it about?

Through a few figures of the student movement, Chelsea Szendi Schieder analyses how masculinism dominated the student protests, how the media created the figure of the female student activist to disparage them and how their militantism was erased to fit a masculinist view of the role of women.

## Final word

It can be a bit dense at time but the book is very interesting
